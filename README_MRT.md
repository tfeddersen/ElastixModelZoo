# MR Thermometry 

###  Registration Description
Rigid, pair-wise, 2D and 3D image registration

###  Image data

Complex valued images obtained from healthy volunteers

###  Application

The aim of this study is to calculate the temperature changes in tisssue using the proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) method.
Since the methods relies on calculating the changes with respect to a baseline scan, any changes in anatomy between this first time point and subsequent scans must be corrected for. In this case, 2D image registration was used to correct the images at later time points and the 3D image registration was only used to quantify the z-motion of subjects. When the motion exeeded >20% of the slice thickess, the particular scan was excluded.
